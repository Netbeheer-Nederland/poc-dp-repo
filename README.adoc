== Python Environment and Dependencies

=== Environment

=== Dependencies

* Dependencies are specified in `requirements.in`.
* Used versions locked in `requirements.txt`.

Both of these files conform to the https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/[`requirements.txt` format] (as per https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/[PEP 508].

This format has been chosen due to its widespread adoption and simplicity. Moreover, it is suitable for both dependency specification and locking using a single format. This is great, since there is no standardized way for lockfiles in Python (and it will take a while with the rejection of https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/[PEP 665] which set out to solve this), leading to all sorts of tools having their own implementation. Using `requirements.txt` retains interoperability.

[TIP]
The lockfile is probably best generated in the GitHub Actions pipeline, as opposed to being checked in in Git.

[NOTE] Why `pyproject.toml`?
--
This is not a Python project, as made clear by the fact that there is nothing to name or version. For this reason, a `pyproject.toml` file - besides offering much we do not need - is not suited.

Moreover, although widely supported, the `pyproject.toml` (as standardized in PEP 621) is not as widely supported as the `requirements.txt` format.

==== Updating the lockfile

The easiest way is to compile the `requirements.txt` file automatically using `uv`:

[code,shell]
....
$ uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
....

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/

[TIP]
There's bound to be other tools such as `pip-tools` that get this job done as well.

'''

[code]
....
$ source .env  # Make all environment variables available to current shell.
....
